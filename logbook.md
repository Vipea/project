Finished a proposal regarding the individual impact of dietary and lifestyle choices on land use, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. Collected data and made a design proposal. However the topic of greenhouse gas emissions was not allowed thus a change of topic had to be made. I researched many different datasets to find a good fit for the final project.

## 04/06
Found a new dataset about different fishing methods that were used in the North Sea. Decided to visualize that dataset against changes in sea fauna per location to assess if there are correlations between increases / decreases in certain fishing methods and the fauna.

## 05/06
Converting all datasets to CSV files in order to process them to JSON files.
Finished technical design, described all functions and my datasets and how I plan to pre-process the datasets for proper usage in D3.

## 06/06
Made a stacked bar chart for the different fishing methods with a colour legend per method.
Also created a horizontal bar chart for the total fauna increase or decrease per location per year.

## 07/06
Created one big JSON file where all the increases and decreases for all individual species per location and per year are put together. Afterwards I integrated this JSON file with my circular bar plot. It is properly working.
