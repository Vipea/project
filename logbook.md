However the topic of greenhouse gas emissions was not allowed thus a change of topic had to be made. I researched many different datasets to find a good fit for the final project.

Found a new dataset about different fishing methods that were used in the North Sea. Decided to visualize that dataset against changes in sea fauna per location to assess if there are correlations between increases / decreases in certain fishing methods and the fauna.
